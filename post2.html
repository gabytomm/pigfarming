        <h1>Top 5 Tips for Healthy Pigs</h1>
        <p>Maintaining the health of your pigs is crucial for a successful and sustainable pig farming business. Healthy pigs grow faster, produce higher-quality meat, and reduce losses due to disease. In this article, we‚Äôll share five practical and effective tips that every pig farmer can implement to improve pig health and productivity.</p>

        <p><strong>1. Provide Clean Water and Balanced Diet</strong><br/>
        Just like humans, pigs need clean drinking water every day to stay hydrated and function properly. Make sure to clean and refill their water troughs regularly. Nutrition is another cornerstone of good health. Feed your pigs a balanced diet containing proteins, vitamins, minerals, and energy sources. Consider supplementing their feed with natural enzymes or probiotics to boost gut health and immunity.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Maintain Proper Sanitation and Hygiene</strong><br/>
        A dirty environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, parasites, and viruses. Clean pig pens at least once a day and dispose of manure properly. Provide dry bedding and ensure good ventilation to prevent respiratory issues. Biosecurity practices such as footbaths, clean clothing, and restricted access can significantly reduce disease introduction and spread.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Schedule Routine Health Checks and Vaccinations</strong><br/>
        Work with a qualified veterinarian to create a vaccination schedule that includes protection against common diseases such as classical swine fever, E. coli, and foot and mouth disease. Monitor your pigs for symptoms such as loss of appetite, coughing, or skin discoloration. Early detection is key to preventing outbreaks.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Control Parasites</strong><br/>
        Internal and external parasites can seriously impact pig health and growth. Deworm your pigs every few months and watch for signs of infestations such as scratching, weight loss, or poor coat condition. Rotate grazing areas if you're using pasture-based farming to break the parasite life cycle.</p>

        <p><strong>5. Minimize Stress</strong><br/>
        Stress weakens pigs' immune systems and increases their susceptibility to illness. Avoid overcrowding, loud noises, and frequent handling. During transportation, ensure pigs are comfortable and not exposed to extreme temperatures. A stress-free pig is a healthy and productive pig.</p>

        <p>Keeping your pigs healthy requires a proactive and informed approach. Follow these tips consistently and stay updated with best practices in animal health management.</p>
