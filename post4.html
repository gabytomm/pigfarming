    <h1>Common Mistakes New Pig Farmers Make</h1>
    <p>Starting a pig farming business can be exciting and rewarding, but many beginners fall into common traps that can lead to financial loss or failure. Awareness of these mistakes is the first step toward avoiding them. In this article, we‚Äôll highlight the most frequent errors made by new pig farmers and how to steer clear of them.</p>

    <p><strong>1. Lack of Planning</strong><br>
    Jumping into pig farming without a clear business plan or feasibility study is a recipe for disaster. Before starting, you must identify your goals, budget, target market, and long-term strategy. Understand local demand, supply chains, and laws governing livestock farming in your area.</p>

    <p><strong>2. Choosing the Wrong Breed</strong><br>
    Not all pigs are created equal. Some are best for meat, others for breeding. New farmers often select pigs based on cost rather than suitability. Choose a breed that matches your climate, farming system, and business goals. Consult local experts or successful farmers for advice.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Poor Housing Conditions</strong><br>
    Inadequate shelter leads to stress, disease, and low productivity. Pens should be well-ventilated, spacious, and easy to clean. Failing to plan for drainage and sanitation can turn your pigsty into a breeding ground for infections.</p>

    <p><strong>4. Underfeeding or Overfeeding</strong><br>
    Many beginners either feed too little to save money or too much without considering the pigs‚Äô actual needs. Underfed pigs grow slowly, while overfeeding wastes resources and can cause obesity-related health problems. Always provide balanced feed based on the pigs' age and purpose.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Ignoring Veterinary Care</strong><br>
    Some farmers try to cut costs by skipping vaccinations and routine checkups. This exposes the herd to disease outbreaks that can wipe out your investment. Build a relationship with a vet and stick to a health management schedule.</p>

    <p><strong>6. Poor Record-Keeping</strong><br>
    If you don‚Äôt track feed costs, weight gain, births, or treatments, you won‚Äôt know what‚Äôs working. Records help you make data-driven decisions and attract investors or credit opportunities in the future.</p>

    <p><strong>7. Expecting Quick Profits</strong><br>
    Pig farming is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It takes time, effort, and patience. Many new farmers give up too soon or fail to reinvest in their business. Success comes to those who treat it like a real business and plan for long-term growth.</p>

    <p>By avoiding these mistakes, you can save time, money, and stress. Pig farming is a learning journey, and being proactive will set you on the path to success.</p>
